# Requests

PMs on Discord and other places are getting out of hand. I need to funnel requests to a central point and make them uniform.

## Regular requests
- Create an [Issue](https://github.com/vxbinaca/archive-env-NG/issues/new)
- Title it `Archival request`

### It should inclde these three things in this order:

- Ingestion Priority (Normal/Emergency)
- Subject type (ex: YTPMV, Kigarumi, Weedtubers, endangered channel, or just rip it)
- Channel/video URL

Try not to ever send me Emergency > just rip it > single video. I'll just take my time with that request or deny it.

Once submitted I will add it to the appropriate script, and close the issue. I may ask more questions however.
