## F.A.Q ##

__Who are you?__

My name Paul Henning, I'm volunteer/amateur archvist with Biblotheca Anonoma (BibAnon) who posts his work primarly to the Internet Archive. 

I'm not a trained archivist and do not have a degree and library sciences nor can I program. I'm literally just some guy. 
My background is in IT and and skilled trades. BibAnon normally focuses on image board culture (4chan/2channel) however I happen to excel at automatic video preservation.

__Why do you save videos__

Because I don't like that governments, companies or 'rights holders' can make culture vanish or be geo-restricted. 
The promise of the internet was that we'd be able to access all knowledge but we only have the [earliest communities and culture
on the internet](https://blog.archive.org/2009/08/25/geocities-preserved/) because of people like me.

__Do you make money off this?__

No. It actually costs me money, and I don't accept donations. Please donate to the Internet Archive instead.

__How do you save all these videos?__

A piece of software I've made small improvements to called [Tubeup](https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup).

The simple explanaton is powerful servers located in multiple places across the world that do nothing but look for new videos from targets I've specified. Once a new video or channel is found, it downloads the video or channel with metadata, journals that it downloaded it so that it dowsn't download it again, then uploads it to the Internet Archive, and when the upload is completed it deletes the video so the servers storage space isn't filled quickly. Either a single video or hundreds. This is done 24/7 with only light input or observation from me.

During hurricane Irma, while my neighborhood was the site of landfall of a Category 4 hurricane and I evacuated days before, the servers were off thousands of miles away doing their intended tasks while I had no power and fuel was difficult to obtain. This is part of the reason I set up this system.
 
__Why the focus on Metadata?__

Because just uploading a [video](https://archive.org/details/youtube-jNQXAC9IVRw) is only half a valueable. Getting the [videos thumbnail, annotations, subtitles and raw video stats](https://archive.org/download/youtube-jNQXAC9IVRw) in a easily readable and consistent way is just as important. Metadata provides a lot of context and information about information.

Think of Metadata like not a phone call, but the date/time/duration of the call.

__Why do you focus on X subject for preservatrion?__

Various reasons depends on the subject. Some are emergency rips where I feel there is a high likelyhood the content is about to vanish, like subjects of breaking news.

Early on I wanted to test if I could actually preserve hundreds of channels, so I tried. Increasingly I'm finding things I randomly saved on whim are gone and now the only copy is the one I have. Some are things I feel should be preserved but increasingly it's only things endangered. I think of the prefrence for some things I have like a bet, and that bet hs paid off multiple times now.
