## F.A.Q ##

__Who are you?__

My name Paul, I'm volunteer/amateur archivist with Biblotheca Anonoma (BibAnon) who posts his work primarly to the Internet Archive. 

I'm not a college trained archivist and do not have a degree and library sciences nor can I program. I'm literally just some guy. 
My background is in IT and and skilled trades. BibAnon normally focuses on image board culture (4chan/2channel) however I happen to excel at automatic video preservation and was given access to code repositories and infrastructure to do my task when I showd initiative.

__Why do you save videos__

Because I don't like that governments, companies or 'rights holders' can make culture vanish or be geo-restricted. 
The promise of the internet was that we'd be able to access all knowledge but we only have the [earliest communities and culture
on the internet](https://blog.archive.org/2009/08/25/geocities-preserved/) because of people like me.

__Do you make money off this?__

No. It actually costs me money. Please donate to the Internet Archive. I am however [accepting tips from Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/T6T7GRVR).

__How do you save all these videos?__

A piece of software I've made small improvements to called [Tubeup](https://github.com/bibanon/tubeup).

The simple explanaton is powerful servers located in multiple places across the world that do nothing but look for new videos from targets I've specified. Once a new video or channel is found, it downloads the video or channel with metadata, journals that it downloaded it so that it dowsn't download it again, then uploads it to the Internet Archive, and when the upload is completed it deletes the video so the servers storage space isn't filled quickly. Either a single video or hundreds. This is done 24/7 with only light input or observation from me.

During hurricane Irma, while my neighborhood was the site of landfall of a Category 4 hurricane and I evacuated days before, the servers were off thousands of miles away doing their intended tasks while I had no power and fuel was difficult to obtain. This is part of the reason I set up this system.
 
__Why the focus on Metadata?__

Because just uploading a [video](https://archive.org/details/youtube-jNQXAC9IVRw) is only half a valueable. Getting the [videos thumbnail, annotations, subtitles and raw video stats](https://archive.org/download/youtube-jNQXAC9IVRw) in a easily readable and consistent way is just as important. Metadata provides a lot of context and information about information.

Think of Metadata like not a phone call, but the date/time/duration of the call.

__Why do you focus on X subject for preservatrion?__

Various reasons depends on the subject. Some are emergency rips where I feel there is a high likelyhood the content is about to vanish, like subjects of breaking news.

Early on I wanted to test if I could actually preserve hundreds of channels, so I tried. Increasingly I'm finding things I randomly saved on whim are gone and now the only copy is the one I have. Some are things I feel should be preserved but increasingly it's only things endangered. I think of the prefrence for some things I have like a bet, and that bet hs paid off multiple times now.

__What about copyright?__

A broad question with multiple meanings and agendas. I'll break down responces to the two underlying meanings to that question.

*What about the copyright of the creators you archive?*

It's better to archive culture first and ask questions later. The soldier who found the Rosetta Stone didn't ask about copyright before taking the artifact. Suppose the stone was left there, it likely would have been destroyed and it would have taken much longer to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs to another language if at all and there'd be raging deate as to the translations. The debate ends with a stone that has ancient egyptian symbols and ancient greek translations because it's easier to go from greek to latin or others, than symbols to hieroglyphs.

However the Rosetta Stone annecdote isn't a good example because theres only one Rosetts Stone, but when you mirror a video you make another copy that serves as a backup of the original in case the original goes down. Nina Paley addresses the assertion that copying is theft, [for the reasons this fun song lays out.](https://archive.org/details/CopyingIsNotTheft1080p).

Take [Weedtube](https://archive.org/details/weedtubers?sort=-date) for example. I'd started in 2015 backing it up because I wanted to capture the dawn of marijuana legalization across the US. A mere year after I started many states got recriational marijuana and that culture grew. In 2018 Youtube took an axe to that culture and terminated the channels of many of it's greatest content producers. The copies on Internet Archive are now the only copies anywhere of some of this content. I've been [repeatedly thanked](http://archive.fo/UKx2b) [by the content creators](http://archive.fo/oywuj) for doing what I did.

As of 2/13/2019 I've uploaded ~140,000 items. I've had DMCA requests for about 10 of them, and a few hundred were requested to be removed either by me or a subject that was in the videos that staff ended up taking care of for me.

In short: I've had an increadibly low rate of anger over my actions, and mostly joy and appreciation. For a hobby, that's pretty good. I'd rather the information be up than not.

*What are your feelings on copyright*

I do not subscribe to the concept of intellectual property. I don't believe in trademarks, patents, state/industry secrets or copyright especially. Fire wasn't invented but borrowed from nature that created it - likely lightening on a tree - and purposed by humans. The internet is the best method of information distribution we've had since verbal communication (even better than Guttenbergs press) of small groups of tool weilding proto-humans because it not only removes most barriers to access but democratizes access to information. It (ideally) makes access egalitarian and (again, idelly) is anti-democratic and subversive to governments. Why are we locking up culture so a class of non-creating managers and lawyers can make money, while the artists who ostensibly benefit from it make 1/100th? Is there a physical loss when a bit-perfect copy of a file is made? All those photos of food on Instagream doesn't replace a meal. Boosting a crate of records from the back of record store delivery truck isn't the same as copying a file. Theft is loss, and mirroring things isn't loss.

In short: All (non-private) information should be availble to everyone at any time instantly, anything stopping it wastes the energy both in trying to stop it and circumventing the controls. It also damages the collective knowledge of humanity.
